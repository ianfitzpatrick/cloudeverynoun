# Cloud Every Noun Bot

@cloudeverynoun 

With much inspiration from F' every word and C Y B E R every word bots, @cloudeverynoun on twitter combines cloud + a random noun from the dictionary.

It has a list of nouns it proceeds through, which is nouns_to_tweet.txt. They have been shuffled.

## Process
No idea where I got the list of nouns. I probably just googled for one? Can't remember and obviously didn't document it in this code.
